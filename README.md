# Code Challenge - Backend Developer

This repository contains my solutions for the Code Challenge as a **Backend Developer**. I have implemented solutions for three problems as listed below:

## 1. Problem 4: Summation Function

Implemented three different approaches in TypeScript to compute the summation of numbers up to `n`. Each implementation has been analyzed in terms of complexity and efficiency.

## 2. Problem 5: A Crude Server

Developed a backend server using **Express.js** and **TypeScript**, with **MySQL** and **Sequelize** for database operations. The server supports CRUD operations for managing resources and includes filtering capabilities.

## 3. Problem 6: Architecture Specification

Designed the specification for an API module responsible for updating a scoreboard with real-time updates.
